Welcome to Agelena Consociata,
this application is a user interface that will help you keep track of your friends' preferences, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers and a couple other things.
The intention of this app is to help the user be a better friend and to not forget important details, meetings, holidays or birthdays.

The current features are:

- Keep track of your friends' addresses, preferences, goals and how you and your friends help or hinder each others' goals.
- Get an overview of your friends' birthdays and never forget a birthday ever again.

Future features:

- Keep track of meetings and talks you had with your friends
- Automatically message people custom messages via WhatsApp, Email or Signal
- Reminders to keep in touch with selected people if you haven't contacted them for a predefined time
- more will come

How to use:

- Setup MongoDB on your local machine
- Setup a database in mongoDB called: 'social_database'
- In this database setup a collection called 'people'
- Your local address for MongoDB should be: mongodb://localhost:27017/ this is already coded, change it if you want to access your database somewhere else.

It is recommended to keep this social database on a local machine over which you have total control. 
The information you collect is extremely sensitive and only you should be able to access it.

It is also recommended and the will of the author to keep the usage of this application ethical.
If you do unethical things with this application, the responsibility is on you.
Enjoy and be a good friend.:-)
